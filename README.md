# Wi-Fi Cracking: A Professional Approach to Network Security Analysis  

## Overview
This project explores Wi-Fi security vulnerabilities using ethical penetration testing in a controlled environment. It demonstrates industry-standard techniques for assessing security, identifying weaknesses, and proposing solutions to enhance wireless network protection.  

## Objectives  
- **Security Assessment:** Identify vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks.  
- **Methodology Validation:** Test penetration techniques with specialized tools.  
- **Security Recommendations:** Suggest measures to strengthen Wi-Fi security.  

## Infrastructure  
- **Hardware:** TP-Link TL-WR840N router, TP-Link TLWN727N adapter, Kali Linux system.  
- **Software:** Kali Linux, Aircrack-ng suite, Wireshark, Nmap, Hydra.  

## Methodology  
1. **Setup Environment:** Configure router and wireless adapter for testing.  
2. **Monitor Mode Activation:** Enable and verify packet capture mode.  
3. **Network Scanning:** Identify available networks and capture handshake data.  
4. **Password Cracking:** Use wordlists to test WPA2 password security.  
5. **Post-Access Analysis:** Perform network enumeration, packet sniffing, and router exploitation.  
6. **Security Hardening:** Implement best practices like WPA3, strong passwords, and MAC filtering.  

## Ethical Considerations  
This project is strictly for educational and research purposes. Unauthorized penetration testing is illegal. Always ensure proper authorization before conducting security assessments.
